        <P style="color:white;">James Allen (1864–1912) was a British philosophical writer known for his inspirational books and essays in the field of self-help and personal development. He lived a relatively short life but made a lasting impact through his writings, which
            continue to influence readers seeking personal growth and transformation. Allen faced significant challenges and hardships during his early life, experiencing poverty and struggling with various adversities. However, these difficulties led
            him on a path of inner exploration and self-discovery, shaping his philosophical views. He authored several influential works, including "As a Man Thinketh, " which remains one of his most famous and enduring writings. This book explores the
            power of thoughts and the impact of one's mindset on shaping life circumstances and achieving success. Throughout his writings, Allen emphasized the importance of self-reflection, positive thinking, and the mastery of one's thoughts as essential
            elements in achieving personal fulfillment and success. Although detailed autobiographical information might not be extensively available, Allen's philosophical insights and teachings on the power of the mind, personal responsibility, and
            the pursuit of inner peace continue to inspire readers worldwide.</Ps>

        <p style="color:white;">
            Part of a series of articles on New Thought Beliefs Movement People Related ideas Categories icon Religion portal vte Born in Leicester, England, into a working-class family, Allen was the elder of two brothers. His mother could neither read nor write.
            His father, William, was a factory knitter. In 1879, following a downturn in the textile trade of central England, Allen 's father travelled alone to America to find work and establish a new home for the family. Within two days of arriving
            his father was pronounced dead at New York City Hospital, believed to be a case of robbery and murder. At age fifteen, with the family now facing economic disaster, Allen was forced to leave school and find work. For much of the 1890s, Allen
            worked as a private secretary and stationer in several British manufacturing firms. In 1893 Allen moved to London and later to South Wales, earning his living by journalism and reporting. In South Wales he met Lily Louisa Oram (Lily L. Allen)
            whom he then wed in 1895. In 1898 Allen found an occupation in which he could showcase his spiritual and social interests as a writer for the magazine, The Herald of the Golden Age. At this time, Allen entered a creative period where he then
            published his first of many books, From Poverty to Power (1901). In 1902 Allen began to publish his own spiritual magazine, The Light of Reason, later retitled The Epoch. In 1903, Allen published his third and most famous book As a Man Thinketh.
            Loosely based on the biblical passage of Proverbs 23:7, "As a man thinketh in his heart, so is he," the small work eventually became read around the world and brought Allen posthumous fame as one of the pioneering figures of modern inspirational
            thought. The book's minor audience allowed Allen to quit his secretarial work and pursue his writing and editing career. In 1903, the Allen family retired to the town of Ilfracombe where Allen would spend the rest of his life. Continuing to
            publish The Epoch, Allen produced more than one book per year until his death in 1912. There he wrote for nine years, producing 19 works. Following his death in 1912, his wife continued publishing the magazine under the name The Epoch. Lily
            Allen summarised her husband 's literary mission in the preface to one of his posthumously published manuscripts, Foundation Stones to Happiness and Success saying: "He never wrote theories, or for the sake of writing; but he wrote when he
            had a message, and it became a message only when he had lived it out in his own life, and knew that it was good. Thus he wrote facts, which he had proven by practice."[1]
